# Change Mail Addresses

This is the place to change the mail addresses of the accounts in the IDM of the
MLU. By changing the addresses here one ensures that the new address available
before the change and that the whole process is logged in the write way and
every importand participant gets noticed about the operation.


## Usage

The script makes two functions available:
1. Check whether a address is available
2. change an existing account to the new mail address

```bash
$ bin/mcp check [MAIL-ADDRESS]
```

```bash
$ bin/mcp change --uid=[UID] --mail=[MAIL-ADDRESS]
```
